## Hello, Quarto!

Quarto is a really powerful tool for producing reports. This template file will help you get started.

The best part about Quarto is that you can mix text and code, like this...

```{r}
print("Quarto > Word")
```

If you ever have a question, the [Quarto documentation website](https://quarto.org/) will almost certainly have an answer!
