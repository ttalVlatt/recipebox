### Course Description

Contemporary higher education researchers have a wide variety of quantitative tools at their disposal.
Yet as the number and sophistication of these tools grows, so too do expectations about the quality of final analyses.
Furthermore, increasing scrutiny of non-replicable results demands that researchers follow a proper workflow to mitigate errors.
In this course, students will learn the fundamentals of a quantitative research workflow and apply these lessons using common open-source tools.
We will cover key skills for crafting reports & publications including project organization, data wrangling/cleaning, and data visualization.
Throughout, students will use coding best-practices so that their workflow may be shared and easily reproduced.

### Course Objectives

Students will learn

1.  Basic data management principles & skills needed for contemporary research in higher education
2.  How to create reproducible research as increasingly required in contemporary higher education research
3.  A foundational knowledge of the R, R Studio, & Quarto

### Grading

There are a total of 100 points for the class, plus extra credit opportunities.

#### Lesson Assignments (50 points)

There are 10 lesson assignments (see assignment tab on each lesson for details and Canvas for due dates), each worth 5 points.
Assignments are always due by **Sunday 11:59pm** following the lesson.

You will receive one of the following grades

-   5/5 everything is correct

-   4.5/5 mostly correct, concepts are all understood, but slight error(s)

-   2.5/5 at least one significant error, **please re-submit**

    -   You will have the chance to revise and resubmit the following week with corrections to get a 4/5

-   0/5 not turned in on time (unless excused)

    -   You will have the chance to submit the following week for 2.5/5

        -   If you are struggling and haven't been able to complete the assignment, it is far better to turn in an incomplete assignment, get 2.5/5 with a chance to improve to 4/5 than miss the deadline

This grading system is designed to encourage you to revisit concepts that didn't click the first time, not to be punitive.
There are opportunities for extra credit to make up for lost points.

#### Reproducible Report (40 points)

Your final project grade comes from four elements

-   Proposal: 5 points

-   Initial analysis: 10 points

-   Presentation: 5 points

-   Report: 20 points

    -   Optional: You can submit a draft of the report for a preliminary grade and feedback on how to improve (see schedule and/or Canvas for due date)

#### Class Participation (10 points)

We will use class time to work through lesson modules together.
Students are expected to follow along with the presentation and run code on their own machine.
Students are also expected to answer questions, participate in discussions, and work through example problems throughout the class session.

Two or more unaccetpable absences could negatively affect your participation grade.
Acceptable reasons for absences include illness, serious family emergency, professional conferences, severe weather conditions, religious holidays, and other university-approved reasons.
Please let us know if you unable to make class for any reason.
Due to the nature of the class and the need for trouble-shooting on your computer, Zoom attendance is not typically an option.

#### Extra-Credit Assignments

On the class website you will see lessons titled "Extra: ..." which are opportunities for extra credit.

-   Lesson follow the same structure as class lessons, review the lesson content then complete tasks in the assignment tab

    -   Time permitting, some extra credit lessons may be completed in class, assignments will still count for extra credit

-   Each extra credit assignment is worth 2.5 points

    -   Simply make a good faith effort to complete the assignment and you will receive the points

-   All extra credit assignments are due during week 16 (see schedule and/or Canvas for due date)

#### Grading Scale

| Grade | Score        |
|-------|--------------|
| A     | 93 or Above  |
| A-    | 90 to 92.5   |
| B+    | 87.5 to 89.5 |
| B     | 83 to 87     |
| B-    | 80 to 82.5   |
| C+    | 77.5 to 79.5 |
| C     | 73 to 77     |
| C-    | 70 to 72.5   |
| D+    | 67.5 to 69.5 |
| D     | 63 to 67     |
| D-    | 60 to 62.5   |
| E     | Below 60     |

: Grading Scale

### Getting Coding Help

1)  Take a break, go outside, get some food
2)  Talk to your [rubber duck](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging)
3)  Talk to your classmates
    -   Please acknowledge with a `## h/t`
4)  Try Google or Stack Overflow
    -   Please acknowledge with a `## h/t` (it helps you later too!)
    -   Caution: the internet does strange things to people... Sometimes people offering "help" can be unnecessarily blunt and/or mean, particularly to people just starting out
5)  Matt's office hours or email
    -   Trying the above steps first really helps me help you
        -   I'd probably start by going through them anyway
    -   I rarely will give direct answers, I just help you think through the issue

Note: As one of the main purposes of this class is to teach you the basics of R programming, the use of AI-based coding tools (such as ChatGPT, GitHub Co-Pilot, Google Bard, etc.) is not permitted.

### UF Graduate School Policies

See [UF Graduate School policies](https://gradcatalog.ufl.edu/graduate/regulations/) on grading, attendance, academic integrity, and more.

### Honor code

UF students are bound by The Honor Pledge which states,

> We, the members of the University of Florida community, pledge to hold ourselves and our peers to the highest standards of honor and integrity by abiding by the Honor Code.
> On all work submitted for credit by students at the University of Florida, the following pledge is either required or implied: "On my honor, I have neither given nor received unauthorized aid in doing this assignment."

The [Honor Code](https://sccr.dso.ufl.edu/policies/student-honor-code-student-conduct-code/) specifies a number of behaviors that are in violation of this code and the possible sanctions.
Furthermore, you are obligated to report any condition that facilitates academic misconduct to appropriate personnel.
If you have any questions or concerns, please consult with the instructor or TAs in this class.

### Accommodations

Students with disabilities who experience learning barriers and would like to request academic accommodations should [connect with the disability Resource Center](https://disability.ufl.edu/students/get-started/).
It is important for students to share their accommodation letter with their instructor and discuss their access needs, as early as possible in the semester.

### Course evaluations

Students are expected to provide professional and respectful feedback on the quality of instruction in this course by completing course evaluations online via GatorEvals.
Guidance on how to give feedback in a professional and respectful manner is available [here](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/students/).
Students will be notified when the evaluation period opens, and can complete evaluations through the email they receive from GatorEvals, in their Canvas course menu under GatorEvals, or [here](https://ufl.bluera.com/ufl/).
Summaries of course evaluation results are available to students [here](https://gatorevals.aa.ufl.edu/public-results/).

### In-class recording

Students are allowed to record video or audio of class lectures.
However, the purposes for which these recordings may be used are strictly controlled.
The only allowable purposes are (1) for personal educational use, (2) in connection with a complaint to the university, or (3) as evidence in, or in preparation for, a criminal or civil proceeding.
All other purposes are prohibited.
Specifically, students may not publish recorded lectures without the written consent of the instructor.

A "class lecture" is an educational presentation intended to inform or teach enrolled students about a particular subject, including any instructor-led discussions that form part of the presentation, and delivered by any instructor hired or appointed by the University, or by a guest instructor, as part of a University of Florida course.
A class lecture does not include lab sessions, student presentations, clinical presentations such as patient history, academic exercises involving solely student participation, assessments (quizzes, tests, exams), field trips, private conversations between students in the class or between a student and the faculty or lecturer during a class session.

Publication without permission of the instructor is prohibited.
To "publish" means to share, transmit, circulate, distribute, or provide access to a recording, regardless of format or medium, to an- other person (or persons), including but not limited to another student within the same class section.
Additionally, a recording, or transcript of a recording, is considered published if it is posted on or uploaded to, in whole or in part, any media platform, including but not limited to social media, book, magazine, newspaper, leaflet, or third party note/tutoring services.
A student who publishes a recording without written consent may be subject to a civil cause of action instituted by a person injured by the publication and/or discipline under UF Regulation 4.040 Student Honor Code and Student Conduct Code.

### A note about taking class during the COVID-19 pandemic

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic continues to disrupt the ways we live each day. We are each trying to keep to "normal" routines all while attending to our health and the health of those we care about---sometimes nearby and sometimes from far away. I find this difficult and I imagine that you might as well.

Two things are true this term. On one hand, we are to continue working with and learning from one another. It's what we do as scholars, yet more mundanely, taking this course also represents progress toward your degree and career goals, which haven't necessarily paused. On the other hand, many of the structures that support your academic progress are currently lacking and, in some cases, non-existent. People are different. Some will appreciate the distraction that coursework can offer; others will find it difficult to concentrate. During this term, you may yourself alternate between being both of these people.

All of this is to say that flexible will be our watchword this semester. In the next pages, you will see the assignments that determine your grade as well as the tentative course schedule. Who knows what this semester will bring, so if you will be flexible with me, I promise to be flexible with you. This is my typical policy, but I want to make it explicit this term. If you are having difficulties, please let me know so that we can do whatever needs to be done for you to be well and successful. You need not share personal details---please simply keep me in the loop.
