title: "Final Project"

-   The final project for this class is to create a truly "reproducible report" on a topic of your choosing related to higher education
    -   The topic can really be almost anything of interest related to higher ed, so long as you can find public data to use
-   Your report should be 3-5 pages *including* multiple graphs and visual elements (i.e., not too much text)
    -   Your goal is something like what you might hand a senior administrator at your university to summarize a trend/issue/topic
        -   You will likely only have a handful of citations
        -   You should devote around half your page space to data visualizations and tables
-   The primary focus of this report is reproducibility
    -   Your data must be publicly available with no IRB restrictions, as you will not submit it, I will go and collect it (unless you download it as part of the project code)

# Proposal (5 points)

This assignment should be submitted as a text entry directly on Canvas consisting of;

1.  A paragraph describing your project:
    -   What will you be investigating/exploring/predicting?
    -   Why is it interesting?
2.  A description of where you will find this data.
3.  A few lines describing your main outcome variable in detail
    -   How is it coded/what scale is it on?
    -   How can you interpret it?

This assignment is worth 5 points, full points will be awarded once satisfactorily completed, multiple re-submissions may be required.

This should be submitted to Canvas by the due date listed.

# Initial Analyses (10 points)

**NOTE**: For your initial analyses, the most important thing is that you submit code that sources/renders in full, this assignment will not be successfully completed until that happens, you may have to resubmit multiple times.

Submit the following in either a cleanly formatted R (`.R`) script or Quarto (`.qmd`) file:

1.  Comments (if an R script) or text (if a Quarto script) that describe
    -   Where your data is from (a link is preferable)
    -   How to download it
    -   Where to save it in order for your code to run
    -   E.g., *For this project I used two .csv data files from IPEDS survey year 2019, institutional characteristics HD2019 and public finance F1819_F1A. These can be downloaded from [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx?year=2019) by clicking on the named files name under "Data Files". To run this code, save these files in a sub-folder called "data" that sits in the same folder as this .qmd file.*
2.  Code that:
    -   Reads in the data set that contains (at least) your dependent variable (must read in EXACTLY what downloads from following your instructions above)
    -   If appropriate
        -   Converts missing values to `NA`
        -   Reshapes the data wider or longer
        -   Joins in additional data files
3.  Code that creates at least three of the following:
    -   A plot that shows the overall distribution of your dependent/outcome variable

        -   Hint: A histogram or density plot might be a good option here

    -   A plot that shows the distribution of your dependent/outcome variable grouped by a variable in your data

        -   Hint: A histogram or density plot with `fill` might be a good option here

    -   A plot that shows the median, interquartile range, and potential outliers of your dependent/outcome variable grouped by a variable in your data

        -   Hint: A box plot with `x` and/or `fill` might be a good option here

    -   A plot that shows how your dependent/outcome variable changes by another continuous variable in your data

        -   Hint: A scatter plot might be a good option here

This assignment is worth 10 points, full points will be awarded once satisfactorily completed, multiple re-submissions may be required.

This should be submitted to Canvas by the due date listed.

# Presentation (5 Points)

-   You will present the results of your report in class during the penultimate week of the semester (see date in Canvas)
-   The presentation format is up to you, previous students have
    -   Presented an image of one figure they created
    -   Created a short PowerPoint presentation
    -   Created presentations using Quarto
-   The primary rule for this presentation is that it is to be **3-5 mins long** (read min 3 mins, max 5 mins, ideal 4 mins)
    -   As this is meant to replicate the you presenting your report to senior administrators, this is a hard time-limit, you will be stopped if you go over 5 mins

This assignment is worth 5 points, your grade will be determined by:

-   3 points: Did you present a plot/table/finding from your report that tells a story about your topic?

-   1 point: Did you present the information in a professional and engaging manner?

-   1 point: Did you finish within the allotted time limit of 3-5 mins?

# Final Report (20 Points)

-   Your final report is a 3-5 page (single-spaced, not including citations) document that summarizes the analysis you have done using plenty of figures and summary tables along the way

    -   This is **NOT** a traditional academic paper, it is meant to be concise report intended for a university administrator or policymaker

    -   5 pages is a hard limit, anything beyond the 5th page won't be graded

    -   **NOTE**: You can submit a draft (for feedback only) by the due date on Canvas

-   You will submit the report as Quarto (`.qmd`) file

    -   The output `format:` should be either `docx`, `pdf` (traditional way using `LaTeX`), or `typst` (brand new way to create a `.pdf`)

        -   I would strongly recommend `docx` for most students

            -   See the [Quarto documentation for word output](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/ms-word.html)

        -   If you're feeling more adventurous, have a go with `typst`

            -   See the [Quarto documentation for typst output](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/typst.html)

            -   You'll need [Quarto 1.4](https://quarto.org/docs/download/https://quarto.org/docs/download/), which came out after the start of the class, see me if you need help installing it

        -   If you want to cause yourself unnecessary misery and frustration by doing it the old fashioned way, use `pdf`

            -   See the [Quarto documentation for pdf output](https://quarto.org/docs/output-formats/pdf-basics.html)

    -   Optional: If your analysis code becomes long, you might want to submit accompanying `.R` scripts that are `source()`-ed as discussed in the [Quarto Lesson](07-quarto-intro.qmd)

### Required Report Content

-   Before the introduction of your document, a section called "Instructions to Run" that states

    -   Where your data is from (a link if preferable)
    -   How to download it
    -   Where to save it in order for the code to run
    -   E.g., *For this project I used two `.csv` data files from IPEDS survey year 2019, institutional characteristics HD2019 and public finance F1819_F1A. These can be downloaded from [here](https://nces.ed.gov/ipeds/datacenter/DataFiles.aspx?year=2019) by clicking on the named files name under "Data Files". To run this code, save these files in a sub-folder called "data" that sits in the same folder as this `.qmd` file.*

-   Well commented code (either in the `.qmd` file or a `source()`-ed `.R` script) that:

    -   Reads in all your raw data (must read in EXACTLY what downloads from following your instructions above)
    -   Performs all data wrangling tasks to clean, join, and reshape your data as necessary for your project
    -   Creates:
        -   Required: 3 or more plots with `ggplot2`
        -   Required: 1 or more overall descriptive statistics table(s) made with `summarize`
        -   Required: 1 or more other summary table(s) made with `summarize`
        -   Optional: Basic statistics like `t.test()` or `lm()`

-   Written text that should be clearly structured with subheadings and describe:

    -   Why this is interesting and/or important
        -   This should be a single concise but convincing paragraph, think an "elevator pitch" argument as to why this matters
        -   There should **NOT** be any lengthy literature review in this assignment, this is it
    -   Why your chose your data source and what the data represents
    -   What analysis you did and why, in layman's terms (not an R or stats expert)
    -   What each individual plot and table shows
    -   What you found overall
    -   Any limitations or future research
